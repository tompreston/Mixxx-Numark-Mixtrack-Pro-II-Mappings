Numark Mixtrack Pro II Mappings
===============================
More updates to MixTrack Pro II by Christie Grinham

##### Keys
* Keylock Button: Slip Mode
* FX-1 Knob: Deck filter
* FX-2 Knob: Deck 1 - Effect Rack 1 Super / Deck 2 - Effect Rack 2 Super
* FX-3 Knob: Nothing
* FX-4 Knob: Deck Gain

* Auto-1 Pad: Keylock
* S4 Pad: 4th Cue

##### Changes

* Keylock has been moved to S4 pad so it is easier to access
* Removed Hotcue delete mode as I never used it, S4 now sets/plays 4th Cue
*If a preview is playing, pressing the Preview button pauses it, otherwise it loads and plays a new preview

I have Mixx set up with reverb loaded in both Effect Rack 1 and Effect Rack 2, with each effect rack dedicated to it's corresponding Deck, so I can have individual reverbs.

Some improvements for the Mixtrack Pro II. Please use GitHub's issue tracker
for bugs, thanks.

Put the two files in `~/.mixxx/controllers`.

Everything is as explained in the manual except for the FX buttons becasue
Mixxx only have one effect. FX1 is the flanger and FX2, FX3 and TAP are
high frequency kill, mid frequency kill and low frequency kill.

Press the files knob to change between folder and file mode, back is unused
at the moment.

Beats knob is pregain.

The three knobs on the top left are LFO Intensity, depth and delay. Top
right are unused.

Top row of pads flash when channel clipping occurs (too loud).
